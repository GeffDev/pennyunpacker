Does the bare minimum of unpacking all data packs based off of `Pack.db` (converted to plain text). I plan on fleshing this out soon.

## Instructions
Compile, copy `files.txt` and the `Pack` folder from game files next to the executable.

## Tools
`decompress_gzip.sh` - Run from inside `Pack/` to decompress all gzipped files (PVR texture files).
